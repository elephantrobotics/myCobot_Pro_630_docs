# Basic function usage

## 1 RoboFlow
The RoboFlow operating system is the operating system of the Elephant collaborative robot, which provides a human-computer interaction interface (its functions include coordinate control, angle control, io control, trajectory recording, gripper control, etc.). Because the RoboFlow operating system runs embedded in our robotic arm systems, users can use the screen or remote connection as a carrier to manually operate the robot, program, and other operations.
