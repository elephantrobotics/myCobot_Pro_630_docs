## Used to grab objects

**introduction**

- The PGE series is a thin parallel electric gripper for industrial use. The number represents the maximum clamping force of the gripper. The gripper jaws are equipped with a pair of parallel fingertips that run symmetrically during movement. The main structure of the clamping jaw is a smooth rectangular structure, which is small in size and saves installation space. It has 5 mounting holes to meet different installation conditions of the device.

- It has fast response speed, high grabbing frequency, and is equipped with an 8-core communication interface. It mainly realizes clamping or jamming of objects and is suitable for relatively light objects.

**working principle**

- The motor drives the rack and pinion and the cross roller guide to realize the opening or closing action of the clamping jaw. The positioning point of the electric gripper is controllable, and the clamping is also controllable.

**Suitable**

- Volume smaller than clamping stroke

- Weight less than maximum clamping weight

- Customizable fingertips can be expanded to more applications
