## For gripping objects

**Introduction**

- The PGE series is a thin parallel electric gripper for industrial use, and the number represents the maximum gripping force of the gripper. The gripper is equipped with a pair of parallel fingertips that run symmetrically during movement. The main structure of the gripper is a smooth rectangular structure with a small size and saves installation space. It has 5 mounting holes to meet different installation conditions of the equipment.

- Fast response speed, high grasping frequency, and equipped with 8-core communication interface, mainly realize the clamping or jamming of objects, suitable for relatively light objects.

**Working principle**

- The motor drives the gear rack and cross roller guide to realize the opening or closing action of the gripper. The positioning point of the electric gripper is controllable, and the clamping is also controllable.

**Applicable objects**

- Volume is smaller than the clamping stroke

- Weight is smaller than the maximum clamping weight

- Custom fingertips can expand more applications
