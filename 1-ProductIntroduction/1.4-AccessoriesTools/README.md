## Design Concept

In the real world, different accessories can enhance a robot's capabilities in various ways. For example, accessories such as grippers, sensors, and tools can help robots perform various tasks, thereby increasing their versatility and flexibility.

Elephant Robotics strives to make robots and these accessories easily accessible to everyone, freeing users from the complexity of choosing the right accessories so they can quickly start using the robot.

## Accessory Type

In order to meet the needs of customers in different scenarios, we have designed various types of accessories, including grippers, suction cups, camera modules and other grasping devices, so that users can directly choose the appropriate end effector.

### Gripper

- [Adaptive Gripper](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.1-Gripper/1-AdaptiveGripper.md)
   The upgraded adaptive manipulator provides greater clamping force and supports multiple programming environments, making it suitable for various industrial robot arms.
- [Electric Gripper](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.1-Gripper/2-ElectricGripper.md)
   The compact structure and multiple connection holes enable the manipulator to meet different installation conditions. It supports IO and serial port control and is suitable for various industrial robot arms.
- [Pneumatic Gripper](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.1-Gripper/3-PneumaticGripper.md)
   It is driven by gas, works through a solenoid valve, and is easy to control. The fingertips of the gripper can be replaced, making it convenient for users to carry out secondary development.
- [Flexible Gripper](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper.md)
   The fingertips are made of rubber and rely on air pressure to deform to grasp objects. Pneumatic manipulators are used in a wide range of applications and are favored for their softness, adaptability and efficiency. These advantages make them powerful tools in automation and robotics applications, capable of efficiently handling various types of objects and tasks.

### Suction cup

### Camera

- [Camera Module](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.3-Camera/1-CameraModulePro.md)

### Holder

- [Pen Holder](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.4-Holder/1-PenHolderPro.md)
- [Phone Holder](../1.4-AccessoriesTools/1.4.4-Holder/2-PhoneHolderPro.md)
