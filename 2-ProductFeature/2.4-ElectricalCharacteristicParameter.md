#### 1 HDMI display interface: Users can display the operation page to other device terminals by connecting to the MicroHDMI display interface

#### 2 Type C: used to connect and communicate with PC, used by developers

#### 3 RS485 interface: supports 485 communication, supports 1000000 baud rate, supports industrial bus protocol, optocoupler isolation

#### 4 Power switch: Controls the on/off of the main power input. When turned off, the controller will also be powered off.

#### 5 Power input interface: This interface is connected to the DC24V power adapter interface

#### 6 USB-C interface: An interface for data connection based on the serial bus standard 2.0; users can use the USB interface to copy program files, or use the USB interface to connect peripherals such as mice and keyboards

#### 7 USB3.0 interface: An interface for data connection based on serial bus standard 3.0; users can use the USB interface to copy program files, or use the USB interface to connect peripherals such as mice and keyboards

#### 8 RJ45 network port: Gigabit specifications

#### 10 Emergency stop circuit terminal: connected to the emergency stop button box, can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot
> **Note**: The emergency stop switch must be connected when the robot is in use, and the emergency stop switch circuit must be connected.
