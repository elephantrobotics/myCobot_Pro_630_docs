## 1 About Python

**Q: Are sample tutorials for Python API available?**

- A: Currently there is a demo. There is a test code in the Test folder of github. You can execute it with the terminal. https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/tree/main/demo

## 2 About ROS

**Q: How do microcontroller-based and microprocessor-based robotic arms run ROS?**

- A: We are currently using Ubuntu for the microcontroller-based robotic arm. We need to download a virtual machine to build a virtual environment and install the Ubuntu system in the virtual environment to run ROS. You can also develop your own ROS. The microprocessor-based robotic arm comes with a ROS environment and can be used directly.

**Q: Can the microprocessor-based robotic arm be connected to a PC to use ros and moveit?**

- A: The current open source data does not have direct communication control. It can be implemented by modifying the existing node files through ros + socket.

**Q: Can you provide rviz model files and programming examples?**

- A: It is provided on our github.
https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros

**Q: When running the slider control and model following commands of ros, why is the error _init_() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given) reported?**

- A: The pymycobot library is not installed and started.

**Q: When using ROS, why is the robot arm angle inconsistent with the model angle after opening the rviz model?**

- A: It is likely that the zero position of the robot arm is not calibrated, and the zero position of the robot arm needs to be calibrated.
