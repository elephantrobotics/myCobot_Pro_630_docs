# myCobot: From 0 to 1

![my](./resources/1-elephant/入门封面.jpg)

### 1.1 Why do we design myCobot
> **An entry-level collaborative robot arm** that everyone can learn and play

The original design of myCobot is to help friends who are interested in 6-axisseries robot to learn it from entry to master, creating unprecedented experience and teaching value.
