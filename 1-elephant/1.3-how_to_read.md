    vision.
-   Understand the building of robot vision scenes and the methods and
    strategies of coordination between vision and robot arm.
-   Grasp all skills of artificial intelligence (AI) packages.

### 2 Division of your background

You should read the book based on your background. We divide the
background and related knowledge into three degrees:
