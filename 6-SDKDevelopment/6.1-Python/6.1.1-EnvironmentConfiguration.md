> **Notice:** Generally, the error results from lack of environment configuration. Refer to **1.3 Environment Configuration** to solve problems.



### 1.3 Environment Variable Configuration 
Windows follows the path set by a Path environment variable in search of **python.exe** . Otherwise, an error will be reported. If you fail to tick `Add Python 3.9 to PATH` during installation, you need to manually add the path where python.exe is located into environment variable or download python again. Remember to tick `Add Python 3.9 to PATH` .

Follow the steps below to add python into environment variable manually.

* Right click on `My Computer` icon -->Properties ->Advanced System Settings ->Environment Variables

* The environment variables include user variables and system variables. For user variables, users can utilize their own downloaded programs via `cmd` command. Write the absolute path of the target program into the user variables.
